# Project OLP REST

- **Description:** A description of your project follows. A good description is clear, short, and to the point. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does.

- **Table of Contents:** Optionally, include a table of contents in order to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.

- **Installation:** Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

- **Usage:** The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.
